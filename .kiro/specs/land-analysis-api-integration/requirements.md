# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements API integration for the land analysis functionality in the AnalysisTab component. Currently, the analysis execution button only logs data to the console. This feature will integrate with the backend `/api/v1/land-analysis/analyze` endpoint to perform actual land analysis based on user-selected criteria including region, use zones, indicators, weights, and ranges.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user performing land analysis, I want the "분석 실행" button to send my analysis criteria to the backend API, so that I can receive actual analysis results instead of just console logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "분석 실행" button THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/api/v1/land-analysis/analyze`
2. WHEN sending the request THEN the system SHALL include all selected analysis parameters in the correct format
3. WHEN an indicator is not selected (false) THEN the system SHALL send null for that indicator's range
4. WHEN the API request is successful THEN the system SHALL handle the response appropriately
5. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper loading states during analysis execution, so that I understand the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis request is initiated THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the "분석 실행" button
2. WHEN the request is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the button to prevent duplicate requests
3. WHEN the request completes (success or error) THEN the system SHALL restore the button to its normal state
4. WHEN the request takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see meaningful error messages when analysis fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns a 400 error THEN the system SHALL display validation error messages
2. WHEN the API returns a 500 error THEN the system SHALL display a generic server error message
3. WHEN the network request fails THEN the system SHALL display a network connectivity error message
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analysis results to be displayed or handled appropriately, so that I can see the outcome of my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis API returns successful results THEN the system SHALL handle the response data appropriately
2. WHEN results are received THEN the system SHALL either display them in the UI or pass them to the appropriate component
3. WHEN results are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current analysis parameters for potential re-analysis
4. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide a way for users to access or view them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API integration to follow the existing service layer pattern, so that the code is maintainable and consistent with the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the API call THEN the system SHALL use the existing landService pattern
2. WHEN adding new API methods THEN the system SHALL follow the existing apiClient configuration
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL leverage existing error handling interceptors
4. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL maintain separation of concerns between UI and service layers
